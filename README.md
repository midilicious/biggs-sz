# Biggs was my dog.
He was the best boy and when I found out I could buy a domain with .dog as the extension, I migrated my homelab services to biggs.dog to honor him.
## What is this?
This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices.
